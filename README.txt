Deactivate the WordPress default image compression.

== Description ==

Deactivate the WordPress default image compression which got introduced with [WordPress 2.5](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/jpeg_quality/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `smntcs-deactivate-image-compression` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

== Purpose ==

By default, WordPress compress every uploaded image by 90%. In combination with other image optimisation tools, this can lead to pixelated images. This plugin deactivates the default image compression to avoid this issue.
